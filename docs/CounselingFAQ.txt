Fee waivers are available for eligible students who have used this fee waiver service for the SAT or ACT. Many schools will have you use the Common App to apply.

How do I get a fee waiver for College/SAT/ACT?
Stop by the Counseling Office in the 300 Building during your lunch/advisement and let the front desk know you need a waiver.

How do I know which schools to apply to?
Applying to two colleges instead of one makes it 40% MORE LIKELY that you’ll enroll in a four-year college. If you apply to more than two, then your chances of enrolling will be even better. We suggest applying to at least 1 of each:
Reach schools: represent an admission challenge either in terms of cost, admission requirements, or both.
Match schools: where you're likely to get in, but you're not quite sure you meet minimum admissions requirements.
Safety schools: where you're sure to be admitted and know you can afford.

With all the different types of deadlines, which one do I choose?
Rolling admissions is a process whereby schools review applications as they arrive, admitting or denying students as they see fit. Students usually hear back within 4-6 weeks. As the process goes, the number of students admitted increases and the number of available spaces decreases, the admission standards become more rigorous.
Regular Applications are reviewed after the deadline date and not before. Though it is recommended to submit your complete application well before the due date, it is not necessary to submit the application earlier than the published deadline date. Schools that use deadlines such as this generally have admissions decisions in the mail by March.
Early Action is a process by which applying early simply gets an answer early. You agree to get the application in by a certain date and the college or university agrees to give you an answer by a certain date. This program is non-binding (you are not required to attend if you are accepted).
Early Decision is binding. If you apply and are accepted, you must attend! You may apply to only ONE college or university early decision. This school should be your clear-cut first choice. Applying early can be an advantage to you in the admissions process, especially if you are a borderline applicant. Schools know if they accept you, you will attend.

How do I request a transcript be sent?
Transcripts should be requested through Naviance by students. Follow these simple steps to have your high school transcript sent electronically to the colleges listed on the site: Go to Naviance through your student portal, Click on Colleges (top), then select “Manage Transcripts”, Click the plus (+) sign and select “College Application Transcript”, Select “Initial” under "What type of transcript are you requesting?", Select where you want the transcript to be submitted, and Click Submit.

What do Colleges Consider?
Each college establishes its unique set of criteria for evaluating applicants, often emphasizing a combination of factors, albeit with varying weights from one institution to another. Academic performance, including GPA, class rank, and the rigor of coursework, is a fundamental consideration. Many colleges focus on grades obtained in core subjects such as English, Math, Science, Social Studies, and Foreign Language. Admissions officers scrutinize transcripts and high school profiles to discern whether applicants have pursued additional or advanced curricular opportunities. Extracurricular activities and community/school involvement also play a pivotal role. It is crucial to be aware of specific high school course requirements for each college, such as the necessity of a consistent Foreign Language study or the inclusion of fine arts courses. For student-athletes aspiring to play in college, understanding the NCAA eligibility requirements is essential, with credit recovery courses not being accepted. Standardized tests like the SAT or ACT are commonly part of applications, with fee waivers available for eligible students. Essays provide an opportunity for applicants to showcase their writing skills and distinguish themselves. Recommendations, often from counselors, teachers, or coaches, offer a broader perspective of the student and are highly regarded. Additionally, demonstrating leadership, earning honors/awards, and active participation in a few meaningful extracurricular activities are favored, highlighting the colleges' preference for well-rounded individuals deeply engaged in specific pursuits.

How do I choose a college?
When choosing a college, it's crucial to consider several key factors to ensure the best fit for your academic and personal growth. Academically, examine the average SAT scores and GPA of admitted students, aligning your application with institutions that match your abilities. Assess the school's prerequisites, ensuring it meets your academic aspirations, whether they are comfortably attainable or a slight stretch. Size matters – decide between a smaller campus offering intimate class sizes and a larger university with diverse programs. Check the graduation rate to gauge the school's effectiveness; inquire about any potential delays in graduation. Location preference is vital – contemplate if you prefer the vibrancy of a big city, the tranquility of a suburb, or the charm of a small town. Evaluate the range of majors offered, ensuring they align with your interests and aspirations. Investigate the academic resources, including the library's adequacy and the campus's technological and lab facilities. Delve into campus life and services, exploring housing options and extracurricular activities like clubs, sports, and cultural events. Equally important are the support services available, encompassing social, health, academic, and financial assistance. By weighing these factors thoughtfully, you can make an informed decision about the college that best suits your needs and ambitions.
