Are you interested in getting a tutor, one-on-one, for your classes at DHS? There are multiple options available for you!

These are the two main tutoring opportunities at Duluth. You can always ask a teacher during their individual hours for help, but this opportunities are always open.
Duluth High School's National Honor Society hosts a service called Peer-to-Peer Tutoring, in which a student comes to visit your advisement and helps you out with classwork and homework. To sign up, check your eClass home page for a link.
Furthermore, the Gwinnett County Public Library hosts tutoring via tutor.com. You can also find this sign up on the eClass page, and you can sign up for physical or online tutoring.

Both of these opportunities are super awesome, so I really recommend that you take every opportunity to be a better student!
