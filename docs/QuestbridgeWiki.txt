What is Questbridge?
Questbridge is a selective full-tuition scholarship (room & board, fees, tuition, and all costs covered) program for low-income students. High school students may apply to Questbridge in the summer before their senior fall. If they are accepted, they become Questbridge Finalists. Finalists can then enter the Questbridge National College Match, which is the chance to receive a full-ride at a Questbridge partner school of their choice.
Questbridge has dozens of partner schools (applications are limited to these schools). You will notice that many of the nation’s top colleges are represented here.


NOTE: Though QuestBridge is a rigorous process, it’s just as rewarding. It is recommended that Duluth Students read over all materials before disregarding it as an option; it’s more possible than you think!

Duluth’s Significance in QB


        Many Duluth students get accepted as QuestBridge finalists and multiple match to top universities. With QuestBridge’s reward, a full-ride and network throughout all four years of college, students, especially Duluth students stand out in the admissions pool. Our communities and stories are beautiful, and they’re worth hearing. It’s HEAVILY recommended that students at least research the program. 




National College Match
The Questbridge National College Match (NCM) is a unique opportunity open to Questbridge Finalists. Finalists make a ranked list of Questbridge partner schools that they would be happy to attend for a full ride. Each school on that list reviews the student’s application as a binding early decision contract. The student is then obligated to attend the school closest to the top of the list that agrees to admit them for a four-year full ride. So, if both your 3rd-ranked and 5th ranked schools accept your application, you are required to attend the 3rd-ranked school. 
* MIT is the only partner school that is non-binding (so if you are matched you can reject the offer!)


A “full-ride” can mean different things in different contexts. For the National College Match, it means the full cost of attendance is covered and that the student’s Family Contribution = $0, among other things. Read through the exact terms of the scholarship here. 


Who can apply to Questbridge?
Questbridge does not outline the clearest eligibility requirements, but there is a focus on being a high-achieving student despite income barriers. They characterize their applicants here, but note that these are not strict cut-offs. While the income limit is also not a strict cut-off, Questbridge does exist to serve low-income students, so income level does factor significantly into eligibility. 
* Do not be discouraged! If you feel paying for college will be a barrier in your collegiate journey, we heavily encourage you to apply to QuestBridge




THE APPLICATION IS EXTENSIVE
The Questbridge application is notoriously long and detailed. Students are required to answer several short answer questions and two longer essays: a biographical essay and an open-topic essay.


You can see the list of National College Match application requirements here. Some important things to note:
* Testing scores are not required but are highly recommended
* You will need two letters of recommendation
* You will need to reach out to your school guidance counselor for a Secondary School Report
   * Check E-Class → Counseling Center if you don’t know who this is)
* And these are just the base requirements. In addition to these, the individual schools that you rank for the National College Match or that you apply to Regular Decision will likely require you to submit their supplemental responses as well. It is important to look at the website’s page for each partner school you are interested in to see what exactly they will require of you.
* THERE ARE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS PER SCHOOL!!!


Prompts
The Questbridge essay and short answer prompts are subjected to change, but they have been consistent for the past several years. Below are the prompts from the past which you can use to begin thinking about what you might write for this year’s responses. Short answers are traditionally 200 words or less.


Essays 
* A biographical essay (required): Please describe the factors and challenges that have most shaped your personal life and aspirations. How have these factors helped you to grow? (800 Words)
* A second essay (choose one):
   * Tell us about a concept, theory, or topic you have explored simply because it sparked your intellectual curiosity. Why do you find it intriguing? How do you want to further explore it?
   * Describe an experience which caused you to change your perspective and/or opinion.
   * What aspect of your current community do you admire and wish to bring to your future college community?
   * Inclusivity involves embracing diversity and working to include people with backgrounds and experiences different from your own. Describe an experience where you have played a role in fostering inclusivity.
* Potentially: Additional supplements per school
Short Answers (200 word limit)
* Tell us about one of your proudest achievements or moments and what it says about you.
* If you could meet a character from a book or a historical figure, who would it be and what would you ask them?




Important Note!


YOU CAN’T APPLY EARLY TO OTHER SCHOOLS!
National College Match applicants who rank colleges cannot apply to other colleges through Early Decision, Early Action, or Single-Choice Early Action (also known as Restrictive Early Action). Even if you rank MIT, which is not binding, you cannot apply early to other colleges.


National College Match applicants who do not rank colleges, or who are not selected as Finalists, are free to apply to any colleges for Early or Regular Decision.


Exceptions: 
1. Students may apply to any college or university that requires an early application for eligibility to special scholarships or programs, as long as the admissions decision is non-binding.
2. Students may apply to their home-state public college or university with a non-binding early application option, as long as applying to QuestBridge does not violate that college's policies.
3. Students may apply to any college or university with a non-binding rolling admission process.


Making your Rankings
In previous years, students who ranked more colleges had a higher chance of matching, however, you must be absolutely certain you would attend every college that appears on your list


*You have the option not to rank colleges, but then you will not be considered for the Match Scholarship and you may only benefit from applying through QuestBridge Regular Decision.


What if you don’t want to rank any schools?
The Questbridge Regular Decision Form is available to all Finalists. You should submit one if you don’t want to enter the NCM and be bound to a school or as a contingency plan if you are interested in the NCM. It is a perfectly legitimate strategy to apply to Questbridge with the intention of just doing its RD system. It is also worth trying the NCM if you feel very strongly about any of the schools.


What if I’m selected as a finalist? 
Fill out the Match Requirements for EACH SCHOOL
You must submit additional materials (called Match Requirements) to each of the colleges on your list by November 1.


*NOTE: If you rank 12 schools, that means you are APPLYING TO 12 SCHOOLS! 




What if I’m matched? 
1. You can be matched to only ONE school.
2. You are committed to attending your match school the following fall. Admission through ranking colleges for the Match is binding except at MIT
3. If matched, you will receive a full four-year scholarship. So you can be confident that you can afford to attend a great college!




EXAMPLE: Say you completed the QB application and were accepted as a Finalist. You now have the option to make a ranked list of 1-12 Questbridge partner schools. Perhaps you feel really strongly about Williams College-- so strongly, in fact, that you were thinking of applying Early Decision there before you learned about Questbridge. You feel similarly about Brown University and Swarthmore College. There are no other schools that you would be comfortable being obligated to attend at this time, so you leave spots 4-12 blank.
1. Williams College (top choice)
2. Brown University
3. Swarthmore College


You submit these rankings. The first school on that list that admits you through the NCM, starting with Williams, is the school you are obligated to attend. In exchange, they will receive a full-ride for all four years of attendance at that school.


Questbridge Regular Decision
The most important thing to know is that not being matched to a school does not mean you were rejected. It simply means that the school did not choose you to be one of their Questbridge matches that year.


Questbridge will eventually make available their Questbridge Regular Decision Form, which you can use to list all of the partner schools you would like to be considered RD for. They will be sent your Questbridge application.


There are many benefits to applying to these schools through Questbridge RD:
1. No application fees
2. They get to read the (excellent) responses you wrote in your Questbridge application
3. Distinction as a Questbridge Finalist
4. And many more


Where to begin?
Your first step should be to research Questbridge partner schools. Are any of the schools ones that you were already interested in on that list? Are there others that you have not considered before? You should take as much time as possible to research the schools. A rankings list truly is a modified Early Decision process. You should not put schools you wouldn’t want to apply ED to on that list. It can be tempting, but QB Regular Decision is for schools you are less in love with.


Our main advice is to:
* Budget time. Make a plan. Stick to it. Begin a schedule for this process at the start of the year if you need to
* Research Questbridge partner schools, even if you did not have them on your list originally
* Identify two adults to write letters of recommendation and reach out immediately
* Take as much time as needed to perfect your essays
* Complete your standardized testing to satisfaction, and make sure you also review each school’s testing requirements




The Truth Of the National College Match


* Most Finalists do not get matched to schools, but many go on to be accepted to them through Regular Decision. You do not automatically enter QB RD; there is a form that they will fill out after becoming Finalists where they can select which schools they’d like to apply to through QB RD.
* For many partner schools, financial need is a major factor in whether or not a student will be matched. Some schools will have x number of Questbridge spots each year, and they may only give them to students who have an Estimated Family Contribution* of $0. A school might really want to admit a Questbridge applicant but simply not be able to because their EFC is too high. They may be hoping to admit that student through Regular Decision.
* While being guaranteed a full-ride to these schools through Questbridge is an excellent deal, many of these schools give excellent financial aid to begin with and may even meet 100% of demonstrated financial need. If you ARE admitted RD, you may still receive an excellent financial aid package.


* Estimated Family Contribution (EFC) is a financial aid term. This denotes the amount of money that a school expects the student and their family to pay toward their education each year. Demonstrated need is the cost of attendance minus the EFC.

* https://questbridge.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/202676207-National-College-Match 
* Individual FAQ pages for each partner school (note that not every school has one)
   * If they do, the URL will be of the form https://questbridge.org/williams-college/faq
* Questbridge blog: it’s likely that whatever is on your mind has been on many other students’ minds, too, and that someone has written a blog post about it
* Email or, better yet, call Questbridge


Questbridge & Estimated Family Contribution (EFC)
QB partner schools all calculate the applicant’s EFC differently, and they also weigh the EFC differently. Some schools, for example, may only consider matching students who have an EFC of 0 while this is not the case for other schools. Source.


Questbridge finalists may be able to convert their rejected match applications to ED applications.
On a school-by-school basis, and the window for conversion may be very short (1-2 days or 12 hours, even). Students should call or email admissions officers ahead of the match to see if this is a possibility.
