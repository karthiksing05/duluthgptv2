TODO to get DuluthGPT ready for next school year!
- get a new calendar CSV file (ask admin)
- bell schedule!!
- get sports games files (honestly see if there's a way to scrape some online website for these, just for autonomy's sake, otherwise ask admin)
- do proofs and find a way to check validity of the LLM (check querying schedules of teachers, teacher teaching stuff, rooms, etc.)
- check other data sources
- figure out how to advertise this!
