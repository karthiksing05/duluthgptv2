Here's the problem:
- the list of files from every year needs to be repeatedly updated, for sure.
- the dynamic files are fine but everything else needs clergy-ing and constant updating
- the hardest thing will be getting someone to maintain / upkeep
- most likely, what will happen is you find someone to take over, introduce them to git and github, and 
  (this is the important part) migrate everything to an email so that people just "get" control once you leave
